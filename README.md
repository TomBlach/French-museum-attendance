Visitors analysis to French museums between 2001 and 2018

Those few graphs and analysis were made for a data visualization class project in october 2020. 
We choosed a public dataset from data.gouv.fr named "Fréquentation des musées de France" : This .csv file shows the entries (free and paid) of each museum which has the title of "Musée de France" between 2001 and 2018.

This project was realised by Tom BLACHON and Matthieu SIMOES.
